    Here is described just how to launch the current version.
    Documentation will be prepared in the future.

    Launch the program:
    ./axis <asteroid> <axis> <delta>
    where:
    <asteroid> - name of the asteroid
    <axis> - semimajor axis of it's orbit
    <delta> - semi-interval of searching (may be 0, then it will be set automatically)

    When the program finishes, a file with results for asteroid will appear.
